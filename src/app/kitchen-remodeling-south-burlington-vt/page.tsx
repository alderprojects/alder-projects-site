Mid-2026 numbers, with South Burlington adjustments.\n\n**Mid-range kitchen remodel** — $35,000-65,000 statewide median (semi-custom cabinets, quartz/granite counters, new appliances, updated electrical).\n**Full gut kitchen renovation** — $60,000-120,000+ statewide median (custom cabinetry, premium stone, professional appliances, full electrical and plumbing rough-in).\n\nIn South Burlington, multiply by 1.05-1.15×.\n\nThe cost driver in South Burlington is the age of the housing stock — pre-1960 homes need supplementary scope (electrical service upgrade, plumbing modernization) on top of the headline service. Get three written bids and ask each one to break out the supplementary scope they expect."

Stack with EVT $2,200 ducted, $400 fuel-switching, $500 panel upgrade rebate.\n\nPair with a heat pump install during the remodel and EVT's $2,200 ducted rebate plus the $400 fuel-switching bonus stack on top of the kitchen scope. Most Vermont kitchen remodels with electrical service upgrades qualify for the EVT $500 panel rebate.\n\n**Trap:** the contractor whose bid quotes a rebate stack from a different utility territory. Ask them to break out each rebate by name and confirm in writing which ones apply to South Burlington (Green Mountain Power (GMP)). Bids that show \"$X off after rebates\" without naming the rebates are the ones that lose money on the actual paperwork."

Avoid the August-October window if the home will be occupied during demolition; that's when interior crews are stretched thinnest."

Per 9 V.S.A. § 4006, your written contract must include scope, total price, completion date, deposit terms, and a 3-day right to cancel. Missing items = unenforceable against you.\n\n**Vermont-specific:** South Burlington has stronger contractor density than rural Vermont, so expect 4-6 serious bids in a typical project. Use the variance to identify the bid that's missing scope (cheapest, often) and the bid that's overpriced for South Burlington (most expensive, often)."
